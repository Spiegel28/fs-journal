# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > We use GIT to store our code and be able to access it and work on it with others without damaging the code. Git is also a way to show off work that has been done in the past. 

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | Create a directory  |

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > A psuedo class is used to define the special state of an element. I think the most common you will see are for buttons. 

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Order of relevance based on the type and order of CSS selectors. You can use specificity to your advantage when styling a whole page or a specific element. 

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > Too many uses of the feature can cause major complications in your style sheet and debugging will  be very difficult the bigger the sheet gets.

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > Selector, property, value

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > Design influences the initial view from the viewer. Poor design can lead to poor judgement on the website owner or company. Design can convey success, time, hard work, emotions and many other things in a website or company. Poor design can reflect poor product.

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > Wireframing helps us plan out the work that we need to do. 

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > I think wireframing is worth the time if we want accurate models. 

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > Flex is something that can be used to create more flexible layouts and align them to your liking 

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > Padding, Margin, border.
