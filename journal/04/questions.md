# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > Synchronous runs sequentially and asynchronous runs independently and concurrently

02. What is an event listener?

  > An event listener is a programming construct used in event-driven programming paradigms to respond to events or signals generated by a user or system. In web development, event listeners are commonly used to handle user interactions with web pages, such as mouse clicks, keyboard input, or changes in the page's state.

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It's an architectural style for designing networked applications. In simple terms, REST is a set of guidelines or principles for building web services that are scalable, flexible, and easy to maintain.

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is invoked inside that function at some point in time.

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > promise is an object that represents an eventual completion or failure of asynchronous operations. You capture an error you would need to use a catch function

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > Get Post Put 

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > Application programming interface 

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > In order to await a promise inside of a function, you need to mark the function itself as async. This allows you to use the await keyword inside the function to pause execution until the promise is resolved or rejected.

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > encapsulation is a key principle in object-oriented programming that promotes data hiding, abstraction, modularity, security, and code reusability, leading to more robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > 200

11. What is a 400 error?

  > means  bad request
