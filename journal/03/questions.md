# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern
01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > Encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism

02. How does `export` differ from `export default`?
  
  > export is for multiple entities and export default is used for one 

03. What is Encapsulation?
  
  > This is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. 

04. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?
  
  > The Proxy object in JavaScript is a feature that allows you to intercept and customize fundamental operations (such as property lookup, assignment, function invocation, etc.) on objects. 

05. What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
  
  > I class can descripe functions and structure while an instance provides details 

06. What is a computed Property?
  
  > allows you to dynamically compute the property name of an object literal or a class declaration

07. What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
  
  > The purpose of the MVC pattern is to improve the organization, maintainability, and scalability of an application by promoting separation of concerns and modularization of code.

08. What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
  
  > Controllers interpret user actions and decide which operations to perform on the Model.
Controllers also update the View based on changes in the Model, ensuring synchronization between the Model and the user interface.

09. What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
  
  > responsible for handling business logic, data manipulation, and interactions with external systems or resources. 

10. What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
  
  > responsible for representing the application's data, business logic, and rules.
