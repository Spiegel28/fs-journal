# Working in a Professional Environment
01. What is Inheritance?

> mechanism that allows a new class (derived class or subclass) to inherit properties and behavior (methods) from an existing class (base class, parent class, or superclass).

02. What is the `Singleton` design pattern?

> The Singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

03. What is the `Observer` design pattern?

> The Observer design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. 

04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

> The Strategy design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

05. What is the `Factory` design pattern?

> The Factory design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It is useful when you have multiple classes that implement a common interface or extend a common superclass and you want to delegate the responsibility of creating objects to subclasses.

06. What is test driven development?

> Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development methodology in which tests are written before the code is implemented.

07. In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?

> In Scrum, the DoD stands for "Definition of Done." It is a clear and concise list of criteria or requirements that must be met for a product backlog item (PBI), user story, or increment to be considered complete and potentially releasable. The Definition of Done helps ensure that all work delivered by the development team meets the agreed-upon quality standards and is in a shippable state.

09. During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?

> The Sprint Backlog is created during the Sprint Planning ceremony in Scrum.

10. In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?

> Tasks are typically assigned during the Sprint Planning ceremony in Scrum.
